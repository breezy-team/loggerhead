LOGGERHEAD
==========

[ Version 1.17 for Bazaar 1.17 ]

Loggerhead is a web viewer for Bazaar branches.  It can be used to
navigate a branch history, annotate files, perform searches... all the
usual things.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

Loggerhead depends on:

1) SimpleTAL for templating.
   On Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install python-simpletal`
   or download from http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/download.html
2) simplejson for producing JSON data.
   On Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install python-simplejson`
   or use `easy_install simplejson`.
3) Paste for the server. (You need version 1.2 or newer of Paste.)
   On Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install python-paste`
   or use `easy_install Paste`
4) Paste Deploy  (optional, needed when proxying through Apache)
   On Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install python-pastedeploy`
   or use `easy_install PasteDeploy`

Then simply run the 'serve-branches' with the branch you want to
serve on the command line:

    ./serve-branches ~/path/to/branch

The script listens on port 8080 so head to http://localhost:8080/ in
your browser to see the branch.  You can also pass a directory that
contains branches to the script, and it will serve a very simple
directory listing at other pages.

You may update the Bazaar branches being viewed at any time.
Loggerhead will notice and refresh, and Bazaar uses its own branch
locking to prevent corruption.

To run loggerhead as a linux daemon:
1) Copy loggerheadd to /etc/init.d
2) Edit the file to configure where your loggerhead is installed, and which
   serve-branches options you would like.
3) Register the service
   cd /etc/init.d
   a) on upstart based systems like Ubuntu run:
      update-rc.d loggerheadd defaults
   b) on Sysvinit based systems like Centos or SuSE run:
      chkconfig --add loggerheadd


LOGGERHEAD AS A BAZAAR PLUGIN
-----------------------------

This branch contains experimental support for using Loggerhead as a Bazaar
plugin.  To use it, place the top-level Loggerhead directory (the one
containing this file) at ``~/.bazaar/plugins/loggerhead``.


USING A CONFIG FILE
-------------------

To hide branches from being displayed, add to ``~/.bazaar/locations.conf``,
under the branch's section:

    [/path/to/branch]
    http_serve = False


More configuration options to come soon.


SERVING LOGGERHEAD FROM BEHIND APACHE
-------------------------------------

If you want to view Bazaar branches from your existing Apache
installation, you'll need to configure Apache to proxy certain
requests to Loggerhead.  Adding lines like this to you Apache
configuration is one way to do this::

    <Location "/branches/">
        ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8080/branches/
        ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8080/branches/
    </Location>

If Paste Deploy is installed, the 'serve-branches' script can be
run behind a proxy at the root of a site, but if you're running it at
some path into the site, you'll need to specify is using '--prefix=/some_path'.


SEARCH
------

Search is currently supported by using the bzr-search plugin (available
at: ``https://launchpad.net/bzr-search``
You need to have the plugin installed and each branch indexed to allow
searching on branches.


SUPPORT
-------

Loggerhead is loosely based on bazaar-webserve, which was loosely
based on hgweb.  Discussion should take place on the bazaar-dev
mailing list at bazaar@lists.canonical.com.  You can join the list at
<https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/bazaar>.  You don't need to
subscribe to post, but your first post will be held briefly for manual
moderation.

Bugs are tracked on Launchpad; start at:

HACKING
-------

To run loggerhead tests, you will need the package python-nose,
and run in the loggerhead directory:

    nosetests
