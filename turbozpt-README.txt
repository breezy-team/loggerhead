TurboZpt
========

This package provides a TurboGears template engine plugin, allowing you
to easily use Zope Page Templates with TurboGears.

Zope Page Templates are assumed to have a "pt" extension.

For information on using a TurboGears template plugin, go here:

At this moment TurboZpt does not do everything KID does. (but neither
does TurboCheetah as far as i'm awhere)

It's far from final and hopefully see lots of intresting updates in the
feature. Hopefully as part of the standard set of TurboGears Plugins. :)
