"""
a cache for chewed-up "change" data structures, which are basically just a
different way of storing a revision.  the cache improves lookup times 10x
over bazaar's xml revision structure, though, so currently still worth doing.

once a revision is committed in bazaar, it never changes, so once we have
cached a change, it's good forever.
