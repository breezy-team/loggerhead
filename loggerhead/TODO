* problem: given a folder, find all revisions where items inside that
  folder have changed.
    -- stumper.  maybe ask on bazaar-dev ML?

* side by side diff?  matty says "overflow-x" css property for horiz scrollbar

* potentially do a 'bzr pull' on a branch on an interval timer

* give this thing a version # or something
* make a loggerhead webpage

* it would be cool to view 1 revision relative to another base, and view the
  diff & download the bundle for that
