* problem: given a folder, find all revisions where items inside that
  folder have changed.
    -- stumper.  maybe ask on bazaar-dev ML?

* side by side diff?  matty says "overflow-x" css property for horiz scrollbar

* make equivalent of start page:
    http://goffredo-baroncelli.homelinux.net/bazaar

* on revision page: view/download patch

* potentially do a 'bzr pull' on a branch on an interval timer

* give this thing a version # or something
* make a loggerhead webpage
