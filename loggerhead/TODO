* problem: given a folder, find all revisions where items inside that
  folder have changed.
    -- stumper.  maybe ask on bazaar-dev ML?
    -- aaron bentley says this is a general problem.

* potentially do a 'bzr pull' on a branch on an interval timer

* it would be cool to view 1 revision relative to another base, and view the
  diff & download the bundle for that

* maybe change "changes" to "history"?  -- asked on bazaar-dev@ for opinions.
