* problem: given a folder, find all revisions where items inside that
  folder have changed.
    -- stumper.  maybe ask on bazaar-dev ML?
    -- aaron bentley says this is a general problem.

* potentially do a 'bzr pull' on a branch on an interval timer

* maybe change "changes" to "history"?  -- asked on bazaar-dev@ for opinions.
    -- nobody seems to care.

* browse view: sort by name, last change?

* something is leaking on www.lag.net/branches

* download tar archive of revision?
