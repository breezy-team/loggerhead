* problem: given a folder, find all revisions where items inside that
  folder have changed.
    -- stumper.  maybe ask on bazaar-dev ML?
    -- aaron bentley says this is a general problem.

* potentially do a 'bzr pull' on a branch on an interval timer

* browse view: sort by name, last change?

* something is leaking on www.lag.net/branches

* download tar archive of revision?

* nicholas allen suggested the ability to change the # of context lines
  in diffs (probably something inside bzrlib) and also the ability to see
  an entire file in diff format

* setup.py install doesn't work
