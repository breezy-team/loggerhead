* problem: given a folder, find all revisions where items inside that
  folder have changed.
    -- stumper.  maybe ask on bazaar-dev ML?

* potentially do a 'bzr pull' on a branch on an interval timer

* give this thing a version # or something
* make a loggerhead webpage

* it would be cool to view 1 revision relative to another base, and view the
  diff & download the bundle for that

* maybe change "changes" to "history"?  -- asked on bazaar-dev@ for opinions.

* flag to tell loggerhead that all branches discovered under a certain folder
  should be auto-published
