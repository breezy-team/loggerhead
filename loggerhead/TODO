* maybe put this at the footer of each page:
    paramiko-dev, 419 revisions, 1133 days old
    first revision: Tue 2003-11-04 08:34:24 +0000
    latest revision: Sat 2006-12-02 18:33:34 -0800
    ...or somewhere.
    ... does this really matter?

* add back the search bar.
    -- should notice dotted-revnos and use that to jump.
	-- also search by date should be simple.

* problem: given a folder, find all revisions where items inside that
  folder have changed.
    -- stumper.  maybe ask on bazaar-dev ML?
