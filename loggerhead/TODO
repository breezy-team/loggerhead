* maybe put this at the footer of each page:
    paramiko-dev, 419 revisions, 1133 days old
    first revision: Tue 2003-11-04 08:34:24 +0000
    latest revision: Sat 2006-12-02 18:33:34 -0800
    ...or somewhere.
    
* the cache-building in History.from_branch() should be an actual on-disk
  cache.  for bzr.dev it takes almost 6 seconds.  also, each 'get_change()'
  call takes almost 1 second.  cache those too.

* add back the search bar.

* add next/prev revision to the bottom of revision_ui.

* some of the pages still aren't updated for start_revid.
* put branch-nick in merge info?
