What's changed in loggerhead?
=============================

1.1.1  [24jan2007]
------------------

    - fix broken inventory page (oops!)
    
    - fix a few rendering problems with kid and safari


1.1  [20jan2007]
----------------

    - new feature to compare two revisions to each other
    
    - inserted text in diffs is now blue instead of green
    
    - fixed to start and stop as a daemon now (use "-f" to run in the
      foreground), and all config is in loggerhead.conf (no need to mess with
      dev.cfg)
      
    - renamed show/hide javascript buttons to expand/collapse, and made them
      much faster
      
    - added an atom-feed link to each branch on the browse page [elliot
      murphy]
      
    - auto-publish feature for multiple branches under a single folder (see
      loggerhead.conf.example)
      
    - added the ability to share cache files per-project instead of just
      per-branch
    
    - added side-by-side diff display for the revision page (which is the
      default), with a button to switch between side-by-side and unified diff
      format

    - made caching use file locking, and close cleanly on shutdown
    
    - miscellaneous speed and page-size improvements


1.0  [23dec2007]
----------------

    - initial release
