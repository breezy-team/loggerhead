What's changed in loggerhead?
=============================

2.0.1 [01Sep2022]
-----------------

    - Read version from setup.cfg when running from tree. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

    - Fix Loggerhead version/revision display in templates. (Colin Watson)

    - Cope with moved errors NoSuchFile and FileExists in newer versions of
      Breezy. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

    - Fix file download links in inventory UI. (Ioana Lasc, #1983654)

2.0.0 [19Aug2022]
-----------------

    - Make RevInfoDiskCache use a marshal version supported by Python 2, to
      ease migration. (Colin Watson)

    - Drop support for Python < 3 and Breezy < 3.1. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

    - Add a ``/health`` target, convenient for health checking in e.g.
      Kubernetes. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

    - Fix highlighting for large files. (Jürgen Gmach, #1966702)

    - Avoid use of file ids - use paths instead. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

    - Port from SimpleTAL to Chameleon. (Colin Watson)

    - Modernize packaging.  There are new dependencies on
      ``importlib_metadata`` (for Python < 3.8) and ``packaging``, in order
      to avoid a self-import in ``setup.py``.  People proxying Loggerhead
      through Apache should install the ``loggerhead[proxied]`` extra;
      people running it via FastCGI, SCGI, or AJP should install the
      ``loggerhead[flup]`` extra. (Colin Watson, #1831661)

1.20.0 [18Jul2021]
------------------

    - Port to Breezy (https://www.breezy-vcs.org/). (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

    - Port to Python 3. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

    - Serve-branches has been renamed to 'loggerhead-serve'. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

    - Fixed weird icon in file lists (e.g. revision summaries) when a file or
      directory with a blank name was listed. (Cruz Bishop, #387337).

    - Add directory icons for directories in file lists (e.g. revision
      summaries). Previously they were using the file icon.
      (Cruz Bishop, #1053340).

    - Format files under one kilobyte as "x bytes". (Cruz Bishop, #990217)

    - Make the number of lines of context in embedded diffs on revision
      pages configurable via a ``context`` query argument. (Paul Nixon)

    - Add ``loggerhead/middleware`` and a few other files to the sdist.
      (Toshio Kuratomi)

    - Widen the line number boxes just a little bit. (Cruz Bishop, #310255)

    - Use breaking word-wrap on the entire information box. (Cruz Bishop,
      #258368)

    - Add some more minor UI changes to do with rounded corners. (Cruz
      Bishop)

    - Set line-height on <pre> elements in file views, fixing misaligned
      line numbers in some browsers. (Colin Watson)

    - Drop dependency on simplejson in favour of the standard library's json
      module in Python >= 2.6. (Colin Watson)

1.18.2 [12Sep2012]
------------------

    - Add ``bzr load-test-loggerhead`` as a way to make sure loggerhead can
      handle concurrent requests, etc. Scripts can be written that spawn
      multiple threads, and issue concurrent requests.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    - HEAD requests should not return body content. This is done by adding
      another wsgi middleware that strips the body when the REQUEST_METHOD is
      HEAD. Note that you have to add the middleware into your pipeline, and
      it does not decrease the actual work done.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #716201)

    - If we get a HEAD request, there is no reason to expand the template, we
      shouldn't be returning body content anyway.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #716201, #716217)

    - Merge the pqm changes back into trunk, after trunk was reverted to an old
      revision. (John Arbash Meinel, #716152)

    - Redirect ``/files/file.txt`` to ``/view/file.txt`` and ``/view/dir`` to
      ``/files/dir``. (Jasper St. Pierre, #569358)

    - Remove ``start-loggerhead`` and ``stop-loggerhead`` which were already
      deprecated. (John Arbash Meinel)

    - Show "Author(s)" as separate from "Committer". And label them
      correctly. (John Arbash Meinel, #733015)

    - The json module is no longer claimed to be supported as alternative for 
      simplejson. (Jelmer Vernooij, #586611)

    - Viewing the ``/changes`` page only iterates enough of the history to show
      the actual revisions displayed, rather than walking the whole mainline.
      Improves performance on projects with long histories like emacs.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    - Fix support for displaying foreign revision ids.
      (Jelmer Vernooij, #736026)

    - Add hook 'controller' to BranchWSGIApp, allowing other bzr plugins
      to provide custom branch-specific controllers. (Jelmer Vernooij, #585822)

    - Add privacy notification code to loggerhead, allowing branches to be
      marked as private and a notification ribbon to be displayed via
      javascript on the view pages. (JC Sackett, #823471)

    - Add a script and documentation for running under mod_wsgi.
      (Stuart Colville, Toshio Kuratomi)

    - Make tz calculations consistent and use UTC in the UI everywhere we show
      a precise timestamp. (Robert Collins, #594591)

    - Avoid crashing when viewing, annotating or downloading a
      non-existent file or revision.
      (William Grant, #728209, #929275)

    - Fix diff and view page styling to be more compact and more easily
      copyable. (William Grant, #743295)
    
    - Some small UI changes; extra border at the bottom of file diffs and
      rounded corners in UI. (Cruz Bishop)

    - Updated the Free Software Foundation address in headers. (Toshio
      Kuratomi)

    - Updated css to handle wrapping of long comments.
      (Francesco Del Degan, #276768)

    - Updated formatting of file sizes in file listings. (Cruz Bishop)

    - Added revision number with release info in the page footer, when
      available. (Cruz Bishop, #392668).


1.18.1 [24Mar2011]
------------------

    - Fix escaping of filenames in revision views.
      (William Grant, #740142)

    - Add missing import to loggerhead.trace, allowing start-loggerhead
      to run when a log.roll config option is set.
      (Max Kanat-Alexander, #673999)


1.18 [10Nov2010]
----------------

    - Syntax highlighting is no longer applied for files greater than 512K,
      reducing codebrowse.launchpad.net overloading.
      (Max Kanat-Alexander, #513044)

    - Documentation added in the docs directory. README simplified
      accordingly. (Tres Seaver).

    - Show svn/git/hg revision ids in loggerhead revision view.
      (Jelmer Vernooij)

    - Fix .bzr/smart access to branches in shared repos. (You also need
      a version of bzr with bug #348308 fixed.) (Andrew Bennetts)

    - Support FastCGI, SCGI and AJP using flup. (Denis Martinez)

    - Repository.get_revision_inventory() was removed in bzr 2.2; use
      Repository.get_inventory() instead. (Matt Nordhoff, #528194)

    - Ignore readonly+ prefix when checking if Loggerhead is serving a
      local location. (Reported by Tres Seaver.) (Matt Nordhoff)

    - Set Cache-Control and Expires headers on static pages.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    - Generate relative links where possible (everywhere but HTTP
      redirects and feed IDs). (Michael Hudson, Matt Nordhoff)

    - Fix bad redirect when visiting "/download" or "/download/".
      (Matt Nordhoff, #247992)

1.17 [20Aug2009]
----------------

    - Add bug links in revision informations (Alexandre Garnier, #314052)

    - Make sure that binary files aren't annotated. (Martin Albisetti,
      #258848)

    - Loggerhead now serves bzr branches over HTTP and exposes the URL
      to branch them. Addresses bug #240577. (Jonathan Lange)

    - Leading blank lines in commit messages no longer result in an
      empty summary. (Colin Watson)

    - Added optional syntax highlighting to annotate view using
      python-pygments.  Partially addresses bug #306631. (Peter Bui)

    - Convert newlines in commit messages to HTML line breaks for
      annotate and changelog views.  Addresses bug #273688. (Peter
      Bui)

    - serve-branches now errors if run behind a proxy without
      paste.deploy installed. (Michael Hudson)

    - Loggerhead should now handle file and directory names that need
      URL escaping without crashing.

    - The start-loggerhead script properly sets the wsgi.url_scheme
      from the server.webpath option. (neror, #260547)

    - The revision page defaults to unified style again, and can
      convert to a side-by-side view using JavaScript. (Michael Hudson)

    - Clean up and improve performance of the annotate view. (Michael
      Hudson)

    - Finish converting JavaScript from MooTools to YUI 3. (Michael
      Hudson)

    - Improve compatibility with IE 6. (Michael Hudson)

    - Leading blank lines in commit messages no longer result in an
      empty summary. (Colin Watson)

    - Clip long lines in side-by-side diff view. (Michael Hudson,
      #334837)

    - The user-confusing "next" and "previous" links now read "older"
      and "newer" respectively. (Michael Hudson, #297930)

    - The annotate view now contains line number anchors. (Michael
      Hudson)

    - Fix inventory pages using "//" in links. (Michael Hudson, #329668)

    - Fix problems viewing files and directories containing spaces and
      other funny characters. (Peter Bui)

    - Changelog messages are now displayed with newlines preserved.
      (Peter Bui, #273688)

    - Offer a link to see the full file diffs for a file path. (Michael
      Hudson, #333797)

    - Fix annotate error caused by Pygments stripping trailing
      whitespace. (Michael Hudson, #338762)

    - Loggerhead can be installed as a Bazaar plugin and run by
      'bzr serve --http'. (Martin Pool)

    - Load parts of the changelog and revision pages via XMLHttpRequest
      to improve performance. This adds a dependency on simplejson or
      json. Partially addresses bug #253950. (Michael Hudson)

    - Various improvements to the animation JavaScript. (Michael Hudson)

    - Fix HTML content of source files being displayed unescaped when

      process. (Matt Nordhoff, #358322)

    - Replace homebrew memory profiling code with Dozer. (Paul Hummer)

    - Use the branch's public_branch as the default suggested URL to
      branch from (Matt Nordhoff, #369767)

    - Fix a file descriptor leak (Matt Nordhoff, #370845)

    - Fix internal server errors when using start-loggerhead. (Matt
      Nordhoff, #375948)

    - Make sure the Atom feeds (nearly) validate. (Matt Nordhoff, #247162)

    - Support serving branches over HTTP using the smart server protocol.
      (Jelmer Vernooij, #306853)

    - Serving branch data was broken when --allow-writes was *not*
      passed. (Michael Hudson, #388730)

    - http_serve config values are interpreted more forgivingly.
      (Michael Hudson)

    - When specifying a remote url to serve-branches, do not share
      connections between threads. (Michael Hudson, #390972)

    - http_serve values from locations.conf are now applied to
      non-branch .bzr data (e.g shared repositories). (Michael Hudson)

    - tags are now displayed. (Cris Boylan, Alexandre Garnier, Michael
      Hudson, #246739)

    - Display Loggerhead's version number at the bottom of the page, and

1.10 [22Dec2008]
----------------

    - Add startup deamon script for Linux (Marius Kruger)

    - Switch navigation from file_ids to paths. Fixes bugs #260363,
      #269365 and #128926. (Martin Albisetti)

    - Fix bug #258710 ("the /files page explodes in an empty branch").
      Also minor improvements to the /files and /changes pages.
      (Marius Kruger)

    - Added --port, --host and --prefix options to serve-branches
      script. (Martin Albisetti)

    - Fixed broken template for project browsing with start-loggerhead
      (Martin Albisetti)

    - Added --reload options to restart the application when a python
      file change. (Guillermo Gonzalez)

    - Added error handling middleware. (Guillermo Gonzalez)

    - Fix bug #243415 ("Tracebacks go to console but not log
      file"). Also minor improvements to logging in serve-branches and
      start-loggerhead. (Guillermo Gonzalez)

1.6 [15Aug2008]
----------------

    - Download a diffs between revisions. (Martin Albisetti)

    - Modified templates to make loggerhead's theme easier to
      change. (Paul Hummer)

    - Default sqlite interface is now sqlite3. (Robert Collins)

    - New ninja theme sponsored by Canonical (Martin Albisetti)

    - Added COPYING file and clarified copyright headers (John Arbash Meinel)

    - Remove the .py extension requiered by the Debian Policy.
      (Jelmer Vernooij)

    - New startup script serve-branches will serve Loggerhead without
      the need of configuration, and allow you to browse through directories
      and branches. (Michael Hudson)

    - Loggerhead is no longer a TurboGears application, but rather a
      WSGI application built using Paste (see http://wsgi.org/ and
      http://pythonpaste.org/ for more about WSGI and Paste).

    - URLs now use revision numbers instead of revision ids (Martin Albisetti)

    - The scripts no longer insist on Python 2.4 -- loggerhead works
      fine with 2.5.

    - Bazaar as of version 1.5 has improved in performance enough that
      the revision cache no longer gave any noticeable benefit, so it
      was removed (the files-changed cache is still useful).

    - The templates were rewritten in Zope's TAL markup, powered by
      the simpleTAL library -- improving both the performance and
      memory consumption of rendering by a factor of around 3 for
      large pages over the old Kid templates.

    - Loggerhead's poorly performing text index was disabled. bzr-search
      is now used if the plugin is installed and a text index is present
      on the branch being viewed. (Martin Albisetti, Robert Collins).

    - Loggerhead no longer depends on bzrlib functions deprecated in
      Bazaar 1.5 and removed in 1.6 (Martin Albisetti).

    - The daemonization code was made more regular, fixing bugs
      #139161 ("Starting loggerhead process may not close its stdin
      and stdout properly") and #211526 ("Codebrowse log directory has
      unnecessarily permissive permissions")

    - Some confusion about what the 'file_id' query argument means was
      cleared up: filter_file_id now means "filter revisions to those
      that affect this file" in all views and file_id means "examine
      this file/directory" in the annotate and inventory views.

    - Dates are present more compactly.

    - The loggerhead.conf file can specify which network interface to
      bind to (Mattias Eriksson)

1.2.1  [06mar2008]
------------------

    - The changelog view was out of order when not using the revision
      cache.

1.2  [04mar2008]

    - Michael Hudson <michael.hudson@canonical.com> has mostly taken
      over the maintenance of loggerhead.

    - loggerhead now has a simple test suite -- use 'nosetests' in the
      loggerhead directory to run it.

    - The rendering performance of pages that display large amounts of
      text was improved by a factor of 4 or so.

    - loggerhead no longer caches the text of the diffs between
      revisions.  It rarely helped and wasted a lot of disk space.

    - The layout of most pages was made more "tight" to waste less
      screen real estate, and some other UI improvements (Kent
      Gibson).

    - Much dead code was removed.

    - Loggerhead now computes the files changed between revisions only
      when it needs to know this.  This is a fairly expensive
      operation in Bazaar, and doing it less massively improves
      performance and memory usage in some situations.

    - Loggerhead now takes a read lock on the branch being viewed for
      the duration of each request, which improves performance
      significantly.

    - Loggerhead no longer uses the corruption-prone Berkely DB-backed
      shelve module for its caches, and rather (ab)uses a sqlite
      database instead.

    - The creation of History objects is much faster for large
      branches (Aaron Bentley).

    - Allow the construction of URLs using revnos and file paths as
      well as revids and fileids (bug #98826):

      - For changes pages, append the newest revno to display to the
        URL, like http://.../changes/<revno>

      - For annotate pages, append the revno to display to the URL,
        followed by the path, like http://.../annotate/<revno>/<path>

      - For file listing and revision pages append the revno to
        display to the URL, like http://.../files/<revno>

      Loggerhead still generates URLs using revision and file ids for
      the moment.

    - Many bugs were fixed:

      - Loggerhead does not escape special characters when embedding a
        revision ID in a URL (bug #88286)

      - Improved robustness in the face of ghosts.

      - Don't crash on displaying a commit with an empty message (bug
        #86247)

      - codebrowse fails with infinite redirections (James Henstridge,
        bug #89854)

      - Loggerhead fails to browse revisions that change binary files
        (James Henstridge, bug #91686)

      - Loggerhead atom feeds expose internal hostname (James
        Henstridge, bug #93585)

      - loggerhead don't like page break character (0x0C) in text
        files (bug #113313)

      - codebrowse source listings don't contain line number anchors
        (bug #98826)

      - only serve up unescaped user content with "Content-Disposition:
        attachment"

      - viewing the file listing consumes a lot memory (bug #116869)

      - loggerhead can't handle empty branches (bug #119228)

      - upgrading the format of a branch behind loggerhead could make
        it fail for that branch (bug #118673)

      - Error parsing non-ascii content (bug #117799)

      - Loggerhead failed on whitespace-only commit messages.

      - Links to diffs from within a revision do not work (bug
        #119422)

      - UTF-8 patches served as ISO-8859-1, fixed by served bundles as
        application/octet-stream (bug #121336)

      - TurboGears was turning query arguments into unicode, and bzr
        stopped accepting unicode revids (bug #175228)


1.1.1  [24jan2007]
------------------

    - fix broken inventory page (oops!)

    - fix a few rendering problems with kid and safari


1.1  [20jan2007]
----------------

    - new feature to compare two revisions to each other

    - inserted text in diffs is now blue instead of green

    - fixed to start and stop as a daemon now (use "-f" to run in the
      foreground), and all config is in loggerhead.conf (no need to mess with
      dev.cfg)

    - renamed show/hide javascript buttons to expand/collapse, and made them
      much faster

    - added an atom-feed link to each branch on the browse page [elliot
      murphy]

    - auto-publish feature for multiple branches under a single folder (see
      loggerhead.conf.example)

    - added the ability to share cache files per-project instead of just
      per-branch

    - added side-by-side diff display for the revision page (which is the
      default), with a button to switch between side-by-side and unified diff
      format

    - made caching use file locking, and close cleanly on shutdown

    - miscellaneous speed and page-size improvements


1.0  [23dec2006]
----------------

    - initial release
